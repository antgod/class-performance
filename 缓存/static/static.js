When your friend speaks his mind you fear not the "nay" in your own mind, nor do you withhold the "ay."And when he is silent your heart ceases not to listen to his heart;For without words, in friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations are born and shared, with joy that is unacclaimed.    When you part from your friend, you grieve not;For that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain.    And let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit.    For love that seeks aught but the disclosure of its own mystery is not love but a net cast forth: and only the unprofitable is caught.    And let your best be for your friend.    If he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also.    For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill?    Seek him always with hours to live.    For it is his to fill your need, but not your emptiness.    And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures.

When your friend speaks his mind you fear not the "nay" in your own mind, nor do you withhold the "ay."And when he is silent your heart ceases not to listen to his heart;For without words, in friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations are born and shared, with joy that is unacclaimed.    When you part from your friend, you grieve not;For that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain.    And let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit.    For love that seeks aught but the disclosure of its own mystery is not love but a net cast forth: and only the unprofitable is caught.    And let your best be for your friend.    If he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also.    For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill?    Seek him always with hours to live.    For it is his to fill your need, but not your emptiness.    And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures.

When your friend speaks his mind you fear not the "nay" in your own mind, nor do you withhold the "ay."And when he is silent your heart ceases not to listen to his heart;For without words, in friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations are born and shared, with joy that is unacclaimed.    When you part from your friend, you grieve not;For that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain.    And let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit.    For love that seeks aught but the disclosure of its own mystery is not love but a net cast forth: and only the unprofitable is caught.    And let your best be for your friend.    If he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also.    For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill?    Seek him always with hours to live.    For it is his to fill your need, but not your emptiness.    And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures.

When your friend speaks his mind you fear not the "nay" in your own mind, nor do you withhold the "ay."And when he is silent your heart ceases not to listen to his heart;For without words, in friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations are born and shared, with joy that is unacclaimed.    When you part from your friend, you grieve not;For that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain.    And let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit.    For love that seeks aught but the disclosure of its own mystery is not love but a net cast forth: and only the unprofitable is caught.    And let your best be for your friend.    If he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also.    For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill?    Seek him always with hours to live.    For it is his to fill your need, but not your emptiness.    And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures.

When your friend speaks his mind you fear not the "nay" in your own mind, nor do you withhold the "ay."And when he is silent your heart ceases not to listen to his heart;For without words, in friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations are born and shared, with joy that is unacclaimed.    When you part from your friend, you grieve not;For that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain.    And let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit.    For love that seeks aught but the disclosure of its own mystery is not love but a net cast forth: and only the unprofitable is caught.    And let your best be for your friend.    If he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also.    For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill?    Seek him always with hours to live.    For it is his to fill your need, but not your emptiness.    And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures.

When your friend speaks his mind you fear not the "nay" in your own mind, nor do you withhold the "ay."And when he is silent your heart ceases not to listen to his heart;For without words, in friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations are born and shared, with joy that is unacclaimed.    When you part from your friend, you grieve not;For that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain.    And let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit.    For love that seeks aught but the disclosure of its own mystery is not love but a net cast forth: and only the unprofitable is caught.    And let your best be for your friend.    If he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also.    For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill?    Seek him always with hours to live.    For it is his to fill your need, but not your emptiness.    And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures.

When your friend speaks his mind you fear not the "nay" in your own mind, nor do you withhold the "ay."And when he is silent your heart ceases not to listen to his heart;For without words, in friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations are born and shared, with joy that is unacclaimed.    When you part from your friend, you grieve not;For that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain.    And let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit.    For love that seeks aught but the disclosure of its own mystery is not love but a net cast forth: and only the unprofitable is caught.    And let your best be for your friend.    If he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also.    For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill?    Seek him always with hours to live.    For it is his to fill your need, but not your emptiness.    And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures.

When your friend speaks his mind you fear not the "nay" in your own mind, nor do you withhold the "ay."And when he is silent your heart ceases not to listen to his heart;For without words, in friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations are born and shared, with joy that is unacclaimed.    When you part from your friend, you grieve not;For that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain.    And let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit.    For love that seeks aught but the disclosure of its own mystery is not love but a net cast forth: and only the unprofitable is caught.    And let your best be for your friend.    If he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also.    For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill?    Seek him always with hours to live.    For it is his to fill your need, but not your emptiness.    And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures.

When your friend speaks his mind you fear not the "nay" in your own mind, nor do you withhold the "ay."And when he is silent your heart ceases not to listen to his heart;For without words, in friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations are born and shared, with joy that is unacclaimed.    When you part from your friend, you grieve not;For that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain.    And let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit.    For love that seeks aught but the disclosure of its own mystery is not love but a net cast forth: and only the unprofitable is caught.    And let your best be for your friend.    If he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also.    For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill?    Seek him always with hours to live.    For it is his to fill your need, but not your emptiness.    And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures.

When your friend speaks his mind you fear not the "nay" in your own mind, nor do you withhold the "ay."And when he is silent your heart ceases not to listen to his heart;For without words, in friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations are born and shared, with joy that is unacclaimed.    When you part from your friend, you grieve not;For that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain.    And let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit.    For love that seeks aught but the disclosure of its own mystery is not love but a net cast forth: and only the unprofitable is caught.    And let your best be for your friend.    If he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also.    For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill?    Seek him always with hours to live.    For it is his to fill your need, but not your emptiness.    And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures.

When your friend speaks his mind you fear not the "nay" in your own mind, nor do you withhold the "ay."And when he is silent your heart ceases not to listen to his heart;For without words, in friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations are born and shared, with joy that is unacclaimed.    When you part from your friend, you grieve not;For that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain.    And let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit.    For love that seeks aught but the disclosure of its own mystery is not love but a net cast forth: and only the unprofitable is caught.    And let your best be for your friend.    If he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also.    For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill?    Seek him always with hours to live.    For it is his to fill your need, but not your emptiness.    And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures.

When your friend speaks his mind you fear not the "nay" in your own mind, nor do you withhold the "ay."And when he is silent your heart ceases not to listen to his heart;For without words, in friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations are born and shared, with joy that is unacclaimed.    When you part from your friend, you grieve not;For that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain.    And let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit.    For love that seeks aught but the disclosure of its own mystery is not love but a net cast forth: and only the unprofitable is caught.    And let your best be for your friend.    If he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also.    For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill?    Seek him always with hours to live.    For it is his to fill your need, but not your emptiness.    And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures.

When your friend speaks his mind you fear not the "nay" in your own mind, nor do you withhold the "ay."And when he is silent your heart ceases not to listen to his heart;For without words, in friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations are born and shared, with joy that is unacclaimed.    When you part from your friend, you grieve not;For that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain.    And let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit.    For love that seeks aught but the disclosure of its own mystery is not love but a net cast forth: and only the unprofitable is caught.    And let your best be for your friend.    If he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also.    For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill?    Seek him always with hours to live.    For it is his to fill your need, but not your emptiness.    And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures.

When your friend speaks his mind you fear not the "nay" in your own mind, nor do you withhold the "ay."And when he is silent your heart ceases not to listen to his heart;For without words, in friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations are born and shared, with joy that is unacclaimed.    When you part from your friend, you grieve not;For that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain.    And let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit.    For love that seeks aught but the disclosure of its own mystery is not love but a net cast forth: and only the unprofitable is caught.    And let your best be for your friend.    If he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also.    For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill?    Seek him always with hours to live.    For it is his to fill your need, but not your emptiness.    And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures.

When your friend speaks his mind you fear not the "nay" in your own mind, nor do you withhold the "ay."And when he is silent your heart ceases not to listen to his heart;For without words, in friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations are born and shared, with joy that is unacclaimed.    When you part from your friend, you grieve not;For that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain.    And let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit.    For love that seeks aught but the disclosure of its own mystery is not love but a net cast forth: and only the unprofitable is caught.    And let your best be for your friend.    If he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also.    For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill?    Seek him always with hours to live.    For it is his to fill your need, but not your emptiness.    And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures.

When your friend speaks his mind you fear not the "nay" in your own mind, nor do you withhold the "ay."And when he is silent your heart ceases not to listen to his heart;For without words, in friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations are born and shared, with joy that is unacclaimed.    When you part from your friend, you grieve not;For that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain.    And let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit.    For love that seeks aught but the disclosure of its own mystery is not love but a net cast forth: and only the unprofitable is caught.    And let your best be for your friend.    If he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also.    For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill?    Seek him always with hours to live.    For it is his to fill your need, but not your emptiness.    And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures.

When your friend speaks his mind you fear not the "nay" in your own mind, nor do you withhold the "ay."And when he is silent your heart ceases not to listen to his heart;For without words, in friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations are born and shared, with joy that is unacclaimed.    When you part from your friend, you grieve not;For that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain.    And let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit.    For love that seeks aught but the disclosure of its own mystery is not love but a net cast forth: and only the unprofitable is caught.    And let your best be for your friend.    If he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also.    For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill?    Seek him always with hours to live.    For it is his to fill your need, but not your emptiness.    And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures.

When your friend speaks his mind you fear not the "nay" in your own mind, nor do you withhold the "ay."And when he is silent your heart ceases not to listen to his heart;For without words, in friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations are born and shared, with joy that is unacclaimed.    When you part from your friend, you grieve not;For that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain.    And let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit.    For love that seeks aught but the disclosure of its own mystery is not love but a net cast forth: and only the unprofitable is caught.    And let your best be for your friend.    If he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also.    For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill?    Seek him always with hours to live.    For it is his to fill your need, but not your emptiness.    And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures.

When your friend speaks his mind you fear not the "nay" in your own mind, nor do you withhold the "ay."And when he is silent your heart ceases not to listen to his heart;For without words, in friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations are born and shared, with joy that is unacclaimed.    When you part from your friend, you grieve not;For that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain.    And let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit.    For love that seeks aught but the disclosure of its own mystery is not love but a net cast forth: and only the unprofitable is caught.    And let your best be for your friend.    If he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also.    For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill?    Seek him always with hours to live.    For it is his to fill your need, but not your emptiness.    And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures.

When your friend speaks his mind you fear not the "nay" in your own mind, nor do you withhold the "ay."And when he is silent your heart ceases not to listen to his heart;For without words, in friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations are born and shared, with joy that is unacclaimed.    When you part from your friend, you grieve not;For that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain.    And let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit.    For love that seeks aught but the disclosure of its own mystery is not love but a net cast forth: and only the unprofitable is caught.    And let your best be for your friend.    If he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also.    For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill?    Seek him always with hours to live.    For it is his to fill your need, but not your emptiness.    And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures.

When your friend speaks his mind you fear not the "nay" in your own mind, nor do you withhold the "ay."And when he is silent your heart ceases not to listen to his heart;For without words, in friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations are born and shared, with joy that is unacclaimed.    When you part from your friend, you grieve not;For that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain.    And let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit.    For love that seeks aught but the disclosure of its own mystery is not love but a net cast forth: and only the unprofitable is caught.    And let your best be for your friend.    If he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also.    For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill?    Seek him always with hours to live.    For it is his to fill your need, but not your emptiness.    And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures.

When your friend speaks his mind you fear not the "nay" in your own mind, nor do you withhold the "ay."And when he is silent your heart ceases not to listen to his heart;For without words, in friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations are born and shared, with joy that is unacclaimed.    When you part from your friend, you grieve not;For that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain.    And let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit.    For love that seeks aught but the disclosure of its own mystery is not love but a net cast forth: and only the unprofitable is caught.    And let your best be for your friend.    If he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also.    For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill?    Seek him always with hours to live.    For it is his to fill your need, but not your emptiness.    And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures.

When your friend speaks his mind you fear not the "nay" in your own mind, nor do you withhold the "ay."And when he is silent your heart ceases not to listen to his heart;For without words, in friendship, all thoughts, all desires, all expectations are born and shared, with joy that is unacclaimed.    When you part from your friend, you grieve not;For that which you love most in him may be clearer in his absence, as the mountain to the climber is clearer from the plain.    And let there be no purpose in friendship save the deepening of the spirit.    For love that seeks aught but the disclosure of its own mystery is not love but a net cast forth: and only the unprofitable is caught.    And let your best be for your friend.    If he must know the ebb of your tide, let him know its flood also.    For what is your friend that you should seek him with hours to kill?    Seek him always with hours to live.    For it is his to fill your need, but not your emptiness.    And in the sweetness of friendship let there be laughter, and sharing of pleasures.    For in the dew of little things the heart finds its morning and is refreshed.    论友谊——摘自纪伯伦的《先知》于是一个青年说：请给我们谈友谊。他回答说：你的朋友是你的有回应的需求。他是你用爱播种，用感谢收获的田地。他是你的饮食，也是你的火炉。因为你饥渴地奔向他，你向他寻求平安。当你的朋友向你倾吐胸臆的时候，你不要怕说出心中的“否”，也不要瞒住你心中的“可”。当他静默的时候，你的心仍要倾听他的心；因为在友谊里，不用言语，一切的思想，一切的愿望，一切的希冀，都在无声的喜乐中发生而共享了。当你与朋友别离的时候，不要忧伤；因为你觉得他最可爱之点，当他不在时愈见清晰，正如登山者在平原上望山峰，也加倍地分明。愿除了寻求心灵的加深之外，友谊没有别的目的。因为那只寻求着要显露自身的神秘的爱，不算是爱，只算是一张撒下的网，只网住一些无益的东西。让你的最佳美的事物，都给你的朋友。假如他必须知道你潮水的下退，也让他知道你潮水的高涨。你找他只为消磨光阴的人，还能算作你的朋友么？你要在生长的时间中去找他。因为他的时间是满足你的需要，不是填满你的空虚。在友谊的温柔中，要有欢笑和共同的喜悦。因为在那微末事物的甘露中，你的心能寻到他的清晓而焕发了精神。');
